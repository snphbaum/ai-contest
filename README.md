===============

This project is mainly a private coding practice and not trying to be of general use.

Several things will be implemented:

- A game library that handles a simple Bomberman clone
- A game server that lets clients play via REST
- A web UI (probably Angular) to play games against another player
- A deep q learning AI that is able to play the game
